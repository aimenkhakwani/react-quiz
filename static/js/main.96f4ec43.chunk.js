You are a tlatoani (noble) in the Aztec world. Although you and your fellow noblemen are only 5 - 10% of the population, you run the government, own land, and command the the army! You also get to wear luxurious capes and jewelry that is limited for your class only. As a tlatoani, you have all the land in your city-sate. However, that can be a lot to maintain. So you can grant some estates to tetecuhtin (high lords) or to temples. These will then be maintained by them, and passed on to their families. You also have several pipiltin (regular nobles) who live in your palace and serve you. And of course, the commoners exist to serve you.

Born a commoner, you attended telpochcalli (school for common youth), and that is where you received your military training. Fully trained warriors are ranked by the number of enemy soldiers they capture. When you first became a soldier, you could only wear plain clothes without any jewelery. Luckily, you are a excellent warrior who has taken many captives and have joined an elite military order, the eagle warriors! Therefore, you now have many privileges. You are permitted to wear fine jewelry (such as headbands and lip plugs), dance at ceremonies, and dine at the palace! These advancements in your status are a product of hard work, and a source of pride for your family!",img:"aztec-warrior.jpg"},{title:"You are: a commoner!",result:"Hello!

As a pochteca (merchant) you have more freedom than most commoners! However, it is time for your family's turn in paying your lord tequitl. Tequitl is payments of goods, such as food and items your family has produced, as well as labor service. All commoner families take turns with providing these duties, and for the next three weeks its your turn.

You are a patrician (wealthy landowner) in Ancient Rome! Born a noble, you received the best education from a private tutor in subjects such as literature, poetry, history, mythology, law, and geography. As a member of the leading class, you will help lead the government. Therefore, you don't need to worry about military duties since you will be excused, unlike the rest of the citizens. You can spend your time as you choose, enjoying music or horse racing or hunting. As a wealthy nobleman, you could also potentially become the next emperor! However, although you are in an exalted position, beware of those around you. This position of power comes with its pitfalls, so surround your self only with those you trust. There is constant power struggles in the palace as others try to grapple for the throne, establish their political place, and gain favor among the Senate. You wouldn't want to pay the price of someone else's betrayal...",img:"roman-patricians.jpg"},{title:"You are: a soldier!",result:"Hello! You are a soldier in the esteemed Roman army! You and your fellow soldiers are the reason Rome can defend itself and continue to grow. Your efforts will not be forgotten, and the Roman army will go down in history as an exceptionally effective military force that allowed an empire to flourish over hundreds of years! As a commoner, you were conscripted at the age of 18. You won't have to serve for the rest of your life, just a specific amount of time (about 20 years). During this time you traveled far and wide to fight. The army had strict disciplinary rules, and the pay is not exorbitant by any means. It's even less after deductions are made for food and clothes. You do have stability though, a regular paycheck, and access to food and doctors. During peaceful times, your base could even have a bath and amphitheatre! Upwards mobility though the army ranks is a rare thing, but possible nonetheless. The good news is, your service is up! You will now be awarded a military diploma, a large sum of money (or land, your choice), as well as acceptance of any marriage! If you were not a citizen, you and your children would also be granted citizenship.

You are part of Ancient Rome's working class, the plebeians. As a baker, you are one of the free and average members of society, alongside farmers and craftsmen. You work hard to provide for your family, and you must also pay the government taxes. You won't have a career in politics or government, so you were not educated and cannot write. Life is not luxurious. In fact, it feels like a daily struggle. However, remember that as plebeians you all make up the majority of the population. When times get unreasonably rough, you all can rise together and riot. The emperor knows that would be dangerous for him and the ruling classes, so he is willing to bribe you. He will control prices and give free grain so  you won't starve, as well as provide free entertainment in the form of gladiators and chariot races! It's not the same as being a noble... but it might have to be enough.
